Note on Large File Storage (git-lfs):
- The STT (Speech-to-Text) functionality using 'faster-whisper' downloads models automatically and does NOT require git-lfs for the STT models.
- If other large models are added to the repository and tracked directly by Git (not downloaded via code), git-lfs might be required for those specific models.
- General git-lfs installation: [link to git-lfs.com or package manager command].
